// Filename: toontown.cxx
// Created by:  lachbr (01Oct20)

// This is a dummy file whose sole purpose is to give the compiler
// something to compile when making libtoontown.so in NO_DEFER mode,
// which generates an empty library that itself links with all the
// other shared libraries that make up libtoontown.
